CrashPlan Log Parser

Author: Vegard Haugland

Info:
-----

CrashPlan provides a great backup experience for your money, but you cannot
access its API as long as you use the home version. This application parses the
CrashPlan log file on your headless server and lets you print statistics and
status information from your CrashPlan setup.

With the status information available, it is quite easy to integrate this
application into a Nagios setup for satisfying your surveillance needs!
